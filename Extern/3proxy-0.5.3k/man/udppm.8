\- UDP port mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "pop3p " [ -ds ]
.IB \fR[ -l \fR[ \fR[ @ \fR] logfile \fR]]
.IB \fR[ -i internal_ip\fR]
.IB \fR[ -e external_ip\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B udppm
forwards datagrams from local to remote UDP port
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.
.TP
.B -e
External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate datagrams
from. 
By default system will deside which address to use in accordance
with routing table.
.TP
.B -i
Internal address. IP address proxy accepts datagrams to.
By default connection to any interface is accepted. It\'s usually unsafe.
.TP
.B -l
Log. By default logging is to stdout. If
.I logfile
is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if
.RI \' @ \'
preceeds
.IR logfile ,
syslog is used for logging.
.TP
.B -s
Single packet. By default only one client can use udppm service, but
if -s is specified only one packet will be forwarded between client and server.
It allows to share service between multiple clients for single packet services
(for example name lookups).

.TP
.I local_port

.TP
.I remote_host

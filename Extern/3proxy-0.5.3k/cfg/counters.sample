# You're billed for traffic except internal networks

# If you exceed 2Gb limit you will have very high penalty
#
# You want to have daily report about common amount of external traffic.
# You also need to know amount of Web traffic for every user
# You want to limit Web traffic to 100Mb/day to whole campus and
# to 20MB/day to every user
